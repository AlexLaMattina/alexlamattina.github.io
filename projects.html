         <h3>Project Darien Dashboards</h3>
         <p>Starting in October of 2020 I worked alongside professors and graduate students
            of the Biomedical Engineering department on
            a research modeling project, Project Darien, to track the spread of COVID-19 across
            the University of Delaware campus. I worked as a programmer to create an interactive
            dashboard that displays and analyzes the team's collected COVID-19 data. I created dashboards
            for the Fall 2020 semster and the Spring 2021 semester. I used Python
            as well as Dash and Plotly to create this model. My code is located on my github and the dashboards
            are also hosted online!

         <h3>Project Darien Educational Model</h3>
         <p> While working with the Project Darien team, I also worked on another project that 
            included creating an Educational Model that simulates the spread of Covid-19. This model 
            is meant to be educational for ages K-12. I used NetLogo, a programming language and development environment
            that is used for agent-based modeling. My model simulated a small town and the user is able to change the input of 
            factors such as number of people, percentage of mask wearing, quarantine settings, and more. 
            The model shows the theoretical number of exposed, infected, hospitalized, and recovered agents.

         <h3>Maize Master IOS Application</h3>
         <p> My Capstone course this year is a senior design project. My team's project is an 
            IOS application that will be used by Sparks Lab at the Univeristy of Delaware 
            which works with falcuty and students who are involved with the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences. 
            We work directly with a client who is a part of the research that is done at Sparks Lab.
            Research in Sparks lab is focused on improving agricultural crop resilience to external forces (strong storms/winds).
            We are created an application that will be used by their team out in the field while conducting research. 
            For this application we have to use Swift to development an IOS application, implement the use of QR codes, and 
            implement the use of bluetooth connection between the IOS device and the tools the team uses. This is still 
            a work in progress!
